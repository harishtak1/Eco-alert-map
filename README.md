# 🌍 Eco Alert Map

**Eco Alert Map** is a web application designed to **report, track, and visualize environmental issues** in real-time.  
The platform enables users to submit environmental problems (like pollution, illegal dumping, deforestation, or water contamination) with details and images.  
These reports are then displayed on an **interactive map**, helping authorities, NGOs, and communities take quick action.
